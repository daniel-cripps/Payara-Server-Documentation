[[overview]]
1. Overview
-----------

Starting with release _4.1.1.164_, the distributed Hazelcast cache can
be used to store the persistent EJB timers of deployed Java EE
applications on the server in a similar manner offered by
link:./payara-micro/persistent-ejb-timers.adoc[Payara Micro's
configuration]

2. Documentation Conventions
----------------------------

_latexmath:[${Product-Root}_ - This is the root of the Payara server directory, referring to where you have Payara installed.  _$]\{Domain}_
- This refers to the name of your Payara domain. `...` - Denotes a
skipping of unrelated code that would be present in the actual file or
program.

3. EJB Persistent Timers Storage Configuration
----------------------------------------------

Traditionally, persistent EJB timers are set to be stored inside a
relational database of configured under the EJB Container component of
the server's configuration (on _$\{Domain}/config/domain.xml_):

``xml <ejb-container>     <ejb-timer-service timer-datasource="jdbc/MyTimerDB"></ejb-timer-service> </ejb-container>`

By default, the server will use the pre-configured `jdbc/__TimerPool`
datasource to store persistent timers into an embedded Derby database
saved into the _$\{Domain}/applications/databases_ directory. To set the
Hazelcast distributed cache to store persistent timers, assign the
`ejb-timer-service attribute` on the `ejb-timer-service` element to
_"Hazelcast"_:

``xml <ejb-container>  <ejb-timer-service ejb-timer-service="Hazelcast"></ejb-timer-service> </ejb-container>`

Take into account that this change can only be made on the domain.xml
configuration, as no alternate _asadmin_ commands (and by extension a
visual element on the admin console) are available.

Keep in mind that to use this altenate data store for persistent EJB
timers, *Hazelcast* must be
link:./hazelcast.adoc#3-enabling-hazelcast[enabled] first.
